# Wikipedia proxy

Hi. Due to limited resources and inefficient code on this capsule, I am shutting down this proxy. Please consider using another proxy:

=> gemini://vault.transjovian.org/

For more information on this decision, see my post:

=> https://pitr.ca/2021-05-29-gemini-ecosystem Scroll to "Wikipedia Proxy" section.

If you can figure out the issue of high memory and high cpu, feel free to send me the fix, or run it yourself.

Thank you for using Wikipedia Proxy on GLV.one
